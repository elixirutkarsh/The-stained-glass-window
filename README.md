# The-stained-glass-window
You have a square stained glass window composed of 100 small glass pieces arranged in a 10x10 grid. Each glass piece is either red or blue on one side.

Your task is to rearrange the glass pieces by flipping them over (changing the color side) so that the stained glass window has a symmetrical pattern when viewed from any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally).

Can you determine the minimum number of glass piece flips needed to achieve the symmetrical pattern? If so, explain your strategy to minimize the flips.

Solution:
To achieve a symmetrical pattern, we need to flip certain glass pieces to ensure that each piece's color is the same as its corresponding symmetrical piece.

Step 1:
Focus on the diagonal of the 10x10 grid. Flip the glass pieces on the diagonal so that the color is the same on both sides.

Step 2:
For each glass piece outside the diagonal, flip it to match the color of its corresponding symmetrical piece on the opposite side of the diagonal.

By following this strategy, we can achieve a symmetrical pattern with the minimum number of glass piece flips. Since there are 100 glass pieces in total, we can determine the minimum flips required to achieve the symmetrical pattern based on the initial arrangement of the colors.
